## CPE400-Final-Project
# Dynamic routing mechanism design in faulty network

# Project description
This project simulates a mesh network where nodes and links may fail. Nodes and links may fail intermittently, as an input to the simulation, each node and link will have a certain probability to fail. When such a failure occurs, the network must adapt and re-route to avoid the faulty node

# Implementation
The project is coded in C++, using a weighted graph to represent the router network. Our routing algorithm uses global information

# Novel contribution
Our novel contribution to this project is that the edge weights in our graph fluctuate through the simulation.
